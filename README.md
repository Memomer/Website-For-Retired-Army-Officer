# Website-For-Retired-Army-Officer

During a brain-storming session with one of my good friend, we had an Idea to make a website for retired army officers from India (60,000 retires/yr + agniveers + misc retirements).

We wanted to build 3 important components for the website->

### The landing/home-page with different kinds of jobs.

### Web-page for each domain/job.


### Get a mentor webpage for army men who have no clue about how to start
  -> registration page for anyone who wants apply as a mentor( mostly people who will benefit from contributing)
  -> its kinda like open source
  -> integrate backend to frontend so registered mentor are verified and added to our frontend.



-> So, basically the website contains 3 UI's one for army men, one for the mentors. and the last containing all the organizations interested
